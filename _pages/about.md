## Hi there! 👋

I'm a Software Development Engineer at [RingCentral](https://www.ringcentral.com/), where I build scalable platforms for AI-driven conversational insights as part of the RingSense-AI team.  

I hold a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering (2024) from [NIT Karnataka](https://www.nitk.ac.in/), where I cultivated a strong passion for AI, systems, and mathematics.  

### Highlights

- **GSoC '24 @ Intel OpenVINO Toolkit**: Developed [VisionGuard](https://github.com/inbasperu/VisionGuard), a gaze-tracking app promoting healthier screen habits, optimized for Intel Neural Processing Units.  
- **Research @ IISc**: Worked with [Prof. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/chandra-sekhar-seelamantula/) on inverse imaging problems: lens-less imaging and single-molecule localization microscopy.  
- **Internships**: Contributed at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com) and [Determinant Studios](https://www.determinantstudios.com).

I love exploring the intersection of ML algorithms and hardware optimization to create efficient, scalable AI systems. Always learning, always building! 🚀
