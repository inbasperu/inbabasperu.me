## About Me

üëã Hello everyone!

I'm an enthusiastic techie who just completed my undergraduate degree in Electronics & Communication Engineering from the [National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK)](https://www.nitk.ac.in). I live in Bangalore, India, and I am deeply passionate about the hardware-software interface, integrating AI/ML and signal processing to uncover the inner workings of computers and electronics.

üíª Currently, I‚Äôm an open-source developer with [Intel OpenVINO Toolkit](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit) as part of [GSoC 2024](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/organizations/openvino-toolkit), working on ["VisionGuard"](https://github.com/inbasperu/VisionGuard), a desktop application optimized to run on Intel AI PCs‚Äô NPUs to track screen usage using AI models. The inference is done on the edge, optimized with OpenVINO for efficient power usage and latency. I'll be coding this in my favorite language, C++, with a sleek GUI interface.

üîç My current focus is on inverse imaging problems, particularly solving the "LASSO Regression" task. I'm doing a research internship at the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in), under the mentorship of [Mr. Kartheek Reddy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3RvB_F8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/chandra-sekhar-seelamantula/), exploring deep learning and iterative optimization approaches.

üöÄ I love diving into the hardware-software interface and understanding computers. My projects include implementing a basic NIC on an FPGA and a pipelined RISC-V processor. I've taken advanced honors PG courses to deepen my knowledge of computer engineering and advanced signal processing courses to enhance my understanding of the mathematical foundations of machine learning.

üåü During a summer internship at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/), I expanded my technical expertise by using Big Data tools such as Spark and AirFlow for ML workflows. My venture into NLP involved developing a named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging engine for an inventory management application at [Determinant Studios](https://www.determinantstudios.com/), enhancing my understanding of open-source LLMs and other NLP concepts.

üìÑ As an IEEE member from the start of my college journey, I have actively participated in the Computer Society and the Computational Intelligence Society (CIS). I mentored projects, conducted sessions, participated in hackathons, and served as Chairman of the [IEEE Computational Intelligence Society NITK Student Chapter](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FgTqNl34U3OFpzElQ0rRkaHE2iargTIX?usp=sharing). My first encounter with ML was through an IEEE project focusing on image captioning with an attention mechanism.

üé® Outside of academics, I love tinkering with computers, experimenting with various Linux distributions, photography, graphic designing, and filmmaking. I also contributed as the [Media and Outreach lead of IEEE-NITK Student Branch](https://www.instagram.com/ieee_nitk/?hl=en) during my second year, exploring my graphic designing interests. As a child, I dreamt of becoming a YouTuber and making short films. Feel free to check out my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRetyVD94WHmt5cRjFx_K4w), but be warned, it's cringey to the fullest extent.

üåç As an open-source tech enthusiast, I am driven by the potential of mathematics and its application in technology. Beyond technical mastery, my ambition is to leverage technology to create solutions that benefit humanity, merging technological innovation with social impact. I'm passionate about continuous learning, always eager to explore new technologies, expand my skill set, and broaden my network. My goal is to make a positive difference in society and be recognized by my peers and colleagues for my contributions to the ever-evolving world of technology.
